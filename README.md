# Microcosm Simulation Project

The Microcosm Simulation Project is a C++ based evolutionary simulation that aims to simulate the life of entities in an environment, as well as their various interactions, such as predator/prey dynamics. It is a comprehensive world simulator with species and biomes that develop and evolve autonomously.

## Overview

The Microcosm Simulation Project is a unique and powerful tool that provides a realistic and interactive experience for simulating the evolution of species and their environment. With this project, you can explore the intricate dynamics of predator and prey interactions, as well as other relationships that develop within the simulated world.

## Features

 - Evolutionary simulation of species and their environment
 - Realistic predator/prey dynamics
 - Dynamic and evolving biomes
 - Autonomous development and evolution
 - C++ based project with CMake for easy compilation

## Getting Started

To get started with the Microcosm Simulation Project, simply download the source code and compile it using CMake. Once compiled, you can run the simulation and start exploring the complex dynamics of the simulated world.
Usage

The Microcosm Simulation Project is highly customizable, allowing you to adjust various parameters and settings to create the ideal environment for your simulations. You can control the number and type of species, adjust the climate and terrain, and modify the rules that govern the interactions between entities.
